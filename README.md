## About This Project
### Description
HrefPrompter enables you to set up and configure a modal containing a message that is displayed when the user on your blog has initiated a redirection request. The redirect then only proceeds, if the user actively chooses to leave the page by clicking the intended button in the modal/confirmation window.

This ensures that your users will have total control over when to stay on your page and when to exit to load an external one.

### Features
* Compliant with the latest regulations regarding data privacy
* Lightweight, configurable and unobtrusive
* Tested for WordPress versions up to 6.3
