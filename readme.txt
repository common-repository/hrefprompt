Adds a configurable layer of confirmation to the redirection to external websites.

== Description ==
HrefPrompter enables you to set up and configure a modal containing a message that is displayed when the user on your blog has initiated a redirection request. The redirect then only proceeds, if the user actively chooses to leave the page by clicking the intended button in the modal/confirmation window.

This ensures that your users will have total control over when to stay on your page and when to exit to load an external one.
